# Problem Set 1 Solution Template
# mysoln is a list to store your answers

# -The first element of the list is a vector of names for the students in your group
# -Make sure these match the names shown on the pdf document provided by the MFE office
# using group 1 as an example:
mysoln <- list(student = c("Molin Liang", "Meghana Rao", "Chengbo Du", "Shardul Kulkarni"))

# 1

# your code

# answers
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- 3
# add to list (start at the second element - the first element is a vectopr of names)
mysoln[["Q1"]] <- c(a, b, c)

# 2

# code

# answers
a <- 1
b <- 2
mysoln[["Q2"]] <- c(a, b)

# 3

# code

# answers
a <- 1
b <- 2
mysoln[["Q3"]] <- c(a, b)

# 4

# code

# answers
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- 3
mysoln[["Q4"]] <- c(a, b, c)

# 5

# code

# answers
a <- c(0,0,0,0,0)
b <- c(0,0,0,0,0)
mysoln[["Q5"]] <- list(a = a, b = b)
